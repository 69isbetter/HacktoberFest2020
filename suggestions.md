<!-- Follow the following format to maintain uniformity:

  I [5hre9a](https://github.com/5hre9a) suggests you that it's okay to make mistakes and fail miserably because with time you're only going to get better.
-->

I [Shreya](https://github.com/5hre9a) suggests you to be patient while coding and solving issues to get better results.

I [hemabhagnani50](https://github.com/hemabhagnani) suggests you that do not worry that others are better than you, just keep in mind that you can and you will.

I [Tina](https://github.com/5hre9a) suggests you to never stop learning.

I [Abhishek Vishwakarma](https://github.com/Abhishek765) suggests you a playlist where you can learn complete web development from html,css,js to backend and Deployment too!! just follow the Link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mbwJ2xhgzM&list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg).

I [Sneha](https://github.com/Snehakri022) suggests you to Donâ€™t give up early, It may take weeks to get started.

I [Anjali Soni](https://github.com/anjalisoni3655) suggest you to explore different fields be it machine learning, development, cyber security, etc atleast once. We will never know where we are actually interested if we dont give some time to explore that field by ourselves. Don't go with the current trend. Be yourself ðŸ™‚.

I [Rachana] (https://github.com/trachana20) suggests you, If you are new to any domain of the Computer science, and working on a project, its better to do the research on the project by reading relevant books, materials and then start the work. Instead of starting off with the project directly and asking help (or using the already written material) on stackoverflow or github or any other platform for every small doubt, doing this would curb the creativity of individual.
